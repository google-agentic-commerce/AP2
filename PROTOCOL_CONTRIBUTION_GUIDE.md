# Contributing Protocol Improvements to Google's AP2 Repository

This guide explains how to contribute core protocol improvements back to the upstream AP2 repository at `https://github.com/google-agentic-commerce/AP2`.

## 🎯 **When to Contribute to Core Protocol**

### ✅ **Core Protocol Improvements** (Submit to Google's repo):
- Security enhancements to AP2 protocol
- Performance optimizations in core components
- Bug fixes in payment processing logic
- New payment method integrations
- Protocol specification improvements
- Core API enhancements
- Authentication/authorization improvements
- Cross-platform compatibility fixes
- Documentation improvements for core features

### ❌ **Product-Specific Features** (Keep in your fork):
- AI Shopping Concierge specific logic
- WhatsApp integration features
- Custom analytics and reporting
- UI/UX improvements for your product
- Brand-specific customizations
- Business logic specific to your use case

## 🔧 **Protocol Contribution Workflow**

### Step 1: Identify the Improvement
```bash
# Make sure you're on the latest main branch
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Create a Protocol Feature Branch
```bash
# Create branch from clean main (synced with upstream)
git checkout main
git checkout -b protocol/feature-name

# Examples:
git checkout -b protocol/enhance-security-validation
git checkout -b protocol/add-payment-method-support
git checkout -b protocol/fix-currency-conversion-bug
git checkout -b protocol/improve-error-handling
```

### Step 3: Implement the Protocol Improvement
Focus on changes that benefit the entire AP2 ecosystem:

```bash
# Example: Security enhancement in core payment validation
# Edit files like:
# - src/ap2/types/payment_request.py
# - src/ap2/validation/security.py
# - tests/test_security_validation.py

git add .
git commit -m "feat(security): Add enhanced payment validation

- Add input sanitization for payment requests
- Implement rate limiting for payment endpoints
- Add comprehensive security logging
- Update validation schemas

Fixes #123
Closes #456"
```

### Step 4: Test Thoroughly
```bash
# Run all tests
cd samples/python
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific protocol tests
python -m pytest tests/protocol/ -v

# Test with your AI Shopping Concierge (compatibility check)
git checkout ai-shopping-concierge-dev
git merge protocol/feature-name
# Test your features still work with the protocol changes
```

### Step 5: Push to Your Fork
```bash
git checkout protocol/feature-name
git push -u origin protocol/feature-name
```

### Step 6: Create Pull Request to Google's Repo

1. **Go to your fork**: `https://github.com/AnkitaParakh/AP2-shopping-concierge`
2. **Click "New Pull Request"**
3. **Set the target correctly**:
   - **Base repository**: `google-agentic-commerce/AP2`
   - **Base branch**: `main`
   - **Head repository**: `AnkitaParakh/AP2-shopping-concierge`
   - **Compare branch**: `protocol/feature-name`

## 🏆 **Examples of Good Protocol Contributions**

### Security Enhancement:
```python
# Before: Basic validation
def validate_payment_request(request):
    return request.amount > 0

# After: Comprehensive validation
def validate_payment_request(request):
    if not isinstance(request.amount, (int, float)):
        raise ValidationError("Amount must be numeric")
    if request.amount <= 0:
        raise ValidationError("Amount must be positive")
    if request.amount > MAX_PAYMENT_AMOUNT:
        raise ValidationError("Amount exceeds maximum limit")
    # Additional security checks...
    return True
```

### Performance Optimization:
```python
# Before: Individual API calls
for item in cart_items:
    validate_item(item)

# After: Batch validation
validate_items_batch(cart_items)
```

### New Protocol Feature:
```python
# Add support for new payment method type
class CryptocurrencyPayment(PaymentMethod):
    def __init__(self, wallet_address: str, currency_type: str):
        self.wallet_address = wallet_address
        self.currency_type = currency_type
        super().__init__("cryptocurrency")
```
