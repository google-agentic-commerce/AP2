# Frequently Asked Questions

1. What can I do with this protocol today?

    - We built sample agents around the core AP2 python library that demonstrate a rich shopping experience. Launch the agents, and try shopping for your favorite products\! These samples mock actual payment service providers so you can explore with no dependencies. Specifically watch for the mandates as the agents do their thing. We will be publishing more samples and SDKs soon, and we'd love to see you're ideas\! You can also use the code samples to create your own implementation of a payment taking place between multiple AI Agents or extend the protocol to show new kinds of payment scenarios (_say, showing a payment made by a different payment method or using a different way of authentication_).

2. Can I build my own agent for any of these roles, taking one of these as a template?

    - Yes you can build your own Agent using any Agent tooling to stand up an Agent. One place to start is the [ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) and [Agent Builder](https://cloud.google.com/products/agent-builder), or anywhere else you can build your own agents.

3. Can I use LangGraph, CrewAI, etc and build the same thing?

    - Absolutely. Any agent, on any framework, on any runtime, is capable of implementing AP2. The easiest way of doing so today is via the A2A extension, but native integrations into each framework will make this even easier in the future.

4. Can I try this out without actually making a payment?

    - You can consider setting this up in your internal environments where you may already have ways to invoke fake payment methods which do not require real money movement.

5. Is there a MCP server or a SDK which is ready for \<my framework of choice\>?

    - We are working on a SDK and a MCP servers right now, in collaboration with payment service providers. Check back soon.

6. My concern is crypto, does this work with x402, ethereum, etc?
    - Yes, AP2 is designed to be broad and supports x402 and crypto transactions, in addition to normalizing Verifiable Credentials and mandates on established payment flows like Cards, bank transfers, and more.
