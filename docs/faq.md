# Frequently Asked Questions

1. What can I do with this protocol today?

    - We built sample agents around the core AP2 python library that
        demonstrate a rich shopping experience. Launch the agents, and try
        shopping for your favorite products\! These samples mock actual payment
        service providers so you can explore with no dependencies. Specifically,
        watch for the mandates as the agents do their thing. We will be
        publishing more samples and SDKs soon, and we'd love to see your ideas\!
        You can use the code samples to create your own implementation of a
        payment taking place between multiple AI Agents or extend the protocol
        to show new kinds of payment scenarios _(say, showing a payment made by
        a different payment method or using a different way of authentication)_.

1. Can I build my own agent for any of these roles, taking one of these as a
    template?

    - Yes you can build your own agent using any of the
        [roles](topics/core-concepts.md). Get started building with
        [ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) and
        [Agent Builder](https://cloud.google.com/products/agent-builder) from
        Google Cloud, or any other platform you choose to build agents.

1. Can I build my own agent to participate in this protocol?

    - Yes, you can build an agent for any of the defined
        [roles](topics/core-concepts.md). Any agent, on any framework (like
        LangGraph, AG2 or CrewAI), or on any runtime, is capable of implementing
        AP2.

1. Can I try this out without actually making a payment?

    - You can consider setting this up in your internal environments where you
        may already have ways to invoke fake payment methods which do not
        require real money movement.

1. Is there a MCP server or a SDK which is ready for <my framework of choice>?

    - We are working on an SDK and a MCP server right now, in collaboration
        with payment service providers. Check back soon.

1. Does this work with x402 standard for crypto payments?

    - We designed AP2 to be a payment-agnostic protocol, so that agentic
        commerce can securely take place across all types of payment systems. It
        provides a secure, auditable foundation whether an agent is using a
        credit card or transacting with stablecoins. This flexible design allows
        us to extend its core principles to new ecosystems, ensuring a
        consistent standard for trust everywhere.

        As a first step, check out
        [google-agentic-commerce/a2a-x402](https://github.com/google-agentic-commerce/a2a-x402/)
        which is an implementation of A2A in conjunction with the x402 standard.
        We will be aligning this closely with AP2 over time to make it easy to
        compose solutions which include all payment methods, including
        stablecoins.

1. What are verifiable credentials?

    - These are standardized, cryptographically secure data objects (like the
        Cart Mandate and Intent Mandate) that serve as tamper-evident,
        non-disputable, and cryptographically signed building blocks for a
        transaction.

1. How does the protocol ensure user control and privacy?

    - The protocol is designed to ensure the user is always the ultimate
        authority and has granular control over their agents' activities. It
        protects sensitive user information, such as conversational prompts and
        personal payment details, by preventing shopping agents from accessing
        sensitive PCI or PII data through payload encryption and a role-based
        architecture.

1. How does AP2 address transaction accountability?

    - A primary objective is to provide supporting evidence that helps payment
        networks establish accountability and liability principles. In a
        dispute, the network adjudicator (e.g., Card Network) can receive the
        user-signed cart mandate and compare the details of what was agreed upon
        between the agent and the consumer against the details in the dispute to
        help determine where liability sits.

1. What prevents an agent from "hallucinating" and making an incorrect
    purchase?

    - The principle of Verifiable Intent, Not Inferred Action addresses this
        risk. Transactions must be anchored to deterministic, non-repudiable
        proof of intent from all parties, such as the user-signed Cart or Intent
        Mandate, rather than relying only on interpreting the probabilistic and
        ambiguous outputs of a language model.

1. Why was crypto and Web3 support included from day one?

    - Supporting a broad range of payment types, including emerging methods
        like stablecoins, ensures the protocol is future-proof. This
        collaboration with partners like Coinbase, Ethereum Foundation, and
        Metamask validates AP2's flexibility and bridges the gap between the
        traditional and Web3 economies, enabling novel use cases like
        micropayments.

1. How can I get involved?

    - AP2 is an open source project created by Google, similar to the A2A
        protocol. Contributions are welcome on Github as discussions, bugs,
        feature requests, and PRs. Additionally we have an
        [interest form](https://forms.gle/uNc1e7hVhirmqcMs5) for private
        communication with Google. Collaboration is happening right now, with
        new samples, integrations and SDKs being developed â€“ Github or the
        interest form are the best ways to communicate with the AP2 team.
