"""A merchant agent for AP2.

The merchant agent's role is to:
1. Provide catalog search capabilities for customers
2. Handle customer inquiries about products and services
3. Support the Agent Payments Protocol for transaction processing

This agent can be run in two modes:
1. ADK mode (for web interface): Uses the root_agent definition below
2. A2A server mode (for production): Uses the __main__.py entry point

          - If you cannot find a product, suggest alternatives
          - Keep responses concise but informative
          - Use the search_catalog tool when customers express shopping intent

          Example Interactions:

          including payment processing, the A2A server mode should be used with
          all four agents (shopping, merchant, credentials, payment processor).
